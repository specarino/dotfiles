### Prerequisite
* [ ] Please consider implementing the feature as a hook script or plugin as a first step.
  * pyenv has some powerful support for plugins and hook scripts. Please refer to [Authoring plugins](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/wiki/Authoring-plugins) for details and try to implement it as a plugin if possible.
* [ ] Please consider contributing the patch upstream to [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv), since we have borrowed most of the code from that project.
  * We occasionally import the changes from rbenv. In general, you can expect changes made in rbenv will be imported to pyenv too, eventually.
  * Generally speaking, we prefer not to make changes in the core in order to keep compatibility with rbenv.
